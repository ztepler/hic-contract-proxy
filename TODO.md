1. refactor HicProxy contract, move all reusable code somehow to the different files
2. make clean FxHashProxy with supporting registry, mint\_issuer, mint, swap and other functionality
3. refactor tests, need to move all sandbox code that can be reused to separate objkt, need to create dirs for different projects (one for h=n, one for fxhash)
